# Disease Prediction System

An AI-powered web application for early disease detection using patient symptoms.  
Built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **scikit-learn**, this system leverages machine learning models to predict potential diseases based on user-input symptoms.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5000 #in your browser

## Features

- Random Forest classifier with 97.6% accuracy
- Interactive symptom selection
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Responsive design
- Search functionality

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn (Random Forest)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5
- **Icons**: Font Awesome
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy

##  Installation

- **Set up a virtual environment using Conda (recommended):**

  ```bash
  conda create -n diseaseenv python=3.11
  conda activate diseaseenv
- **Install Git (if not already installed):**

- Download Git
  ```bash
  https://git-scm.com/downloads #visit this page & install according to ur OS

- Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nagabhushanaraju/Early_Desease_Predictor.git
    
    cd Early_Desease_Predictor

-Install required dependencies inside the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```



## How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: The application loads the training dataset and trains a Random Forest classifier
2. **Symptom Selection**: Users select their symptoms from a comprehensive list
3. **Feature Vector**: Selected symptoms are converted to a binary feature vector
4. **Prediction**: The trained model predicts the most likely disease
5. **Results**: Displays the prediction with confidence score and alternative conditions

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: 97.6% on test data
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 132 binary symptom features
- **Diseases**: Multiple disease categories

## Important Disclaimer

⚠️ **This tool is for educational purposes only.**

- The predictions are based on machine learning algorithms and should not replace professional medical advice
- Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals for proper diagnosis and treatment
- The system is designed as a learning tool and demonstration of AI capabilities

## Customization

### Adding New Symptoms
1. Update the `Training.csv` and `Testing.csv` files
2. Retrain the model by running the application

### Modifying the UI
1. Edit `templates/index.html` for layout changes
2. Modify `static/style.css` for styling
3. Update `static/script.js` for functionality

### Model Parameters
Adjust the Random Forest parameters in `app.py`:
```python
model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,      # Number of trees
    min_samples_split=2,   # Minimum samples to split
    random_state=67        # For reproducibility
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**:
   - Change the port in `app.py`: `app.run(debug=True, port=5001)`

2. **Missing dependencies**:
   - Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Data files not found**:
   - Ensure `Training.csv` and `Testing.csv` are in the project directory

4. **Model training errors**:
   - Check that the CSV files have the correct format
   - Verify all required columns are present
